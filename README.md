Project Description:

Our Project title is "Online Reservation System (ORS)". We tried out best to make the complicated 
process of Online Reservation System as simple as possible using structural & modular & menu 
oriented interface. We have tried to design the project in such a way that user may not have any 
difficulty in using this package and further expansion is possible without much effort. Even though I 
cannot claim that this work to be entirely exhaustive, the main purpose of my exercise is perform each 
employees activity computerized way rather than manually which is time consuming
I am confident that this software package can be readily used by non-programming personal avoiding 
human handled chance of error. This project is used by two types of users:
i. User
ii. Admin
Users can view the availability of train, airlines and users can register themselves to book any route 
Admin can maintain daily updates in the routes, seats. Administrator must be an authorized user. 
She/he can change the used the password.
The main aim of the entire activity is to automate the process of day to day activities, Admission of a 
new customer, Assign seats on their routes according to customer's demand, and finally compute the bill
